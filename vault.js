For this assignment: 
I am going to first build the string telling the user that they've been chosen to open an important vault.
Next I will build the unique arithmetic operator that equals the codes in the combination
Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes
Vault Codes are: 10 - 40 - 39

/* for the sequence below I assigned a value for each "num" */
let num1 = 5 * 2 /* will show the number 10 */

let num2 = 80 / 2 /* will show the number 20 */

let num3 = 30 + 9 /* will show the number 39 */

/* using the handy-dandy alert window again I displayed the vault combo by creating a string using the num nums and separated them using quotations */
